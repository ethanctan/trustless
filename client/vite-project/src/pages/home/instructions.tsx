        <p className="mb-2">
          Within 36 hours, you can earn $TRUST tokens by submitting protocol ratings, with larger airdrops awarded for ratings that align with the consensus. 
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You can rate once for every protocol, for up to over 3000 DeFi protocols.
          </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The consensus (average) rating will be released after the 36-hour period. Then you'll be able to claim your airdrop and, more importantly, see how trustworthy the crypto community thinks each protocol is.
